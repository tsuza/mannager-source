    <summary>Source Engine Dedicated Server Manager written in Rust</summary>
    <description>
        <p>            
            MANNager is an open-source Source Engine Dedicated Server Manager written in Rust, with the Iced GUI library.
            It aims to provide a simple, functional and straight forward way to download, update and manage server for Windows, and Linux platforms.
            It's mainly meant to be use for local usage, such as testing and the development of Sourcemod plugins, though
            automatic port forwarding is implemented to allow outside people to join your server, in case you want it.
